I
Just wanted to believe
That maybe you'd be good to maybe
I'm just misunderstood, you see
You
Never had a clue
All the days that I spent loving you
Who am I supposed to give 'em to?
I let you in
Again and Again
So tell me, baby
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you
I'm
Bidding you farewell
You'd never stand a chance in hell
They've got another clientele
You're
Treading at the shore
I bet you've never drowned before
And someone that you'd do it for
I let you in
Again and Again
So tell me, baby
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you
